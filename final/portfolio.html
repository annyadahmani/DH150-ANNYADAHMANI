The focus of this project is to design a resource incorporating what makes middle-aged women happy. I was inspired by my mother and 
    what makes her happy. My mom loves to bake and durinng the COVID-19 pandemic, she has a lot more time on her hands to explore this happiness. 
    However, a lot of baking sources aren't tailored to her needs and wants in a baking. Thus, the goal of my project was to create a baking 
    app that was easy, fun, resourceful, and created happiness. <br>

      <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues 
        to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not 
        usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of 
        middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, 
        it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.</p>

     I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user’s perspective, 
      how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen 
      and facial expressions were recorded. 
<br>
<p class="card-title">Main Findings: </p>

<ul>
<li> All participants were able to complete the three tasks.</li>
<li>Home screen fonts were too small.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time getting to the "done" button after adding a book to their "want to read" bookshelf.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time finding the "share" button.</li>
<li>The "write a book log" was the function least likely to be used by these participants.</li>
<li>Adjectives used the most frequently to describe this app were: creative, familiar, and trustworthy.</li>

    Conclusion
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
      <p>I learned several things during my DH 150 project on the UCLA Bruins app. <br><br> 
        Tradeoffs: UX design is all about tradeoffs. In choosing whether or not to include certain information into my designs, 
        I was constantly faced with dilemmas: do I add more information and make the interface slightly more cluttered, or do I 
        retain the minimalist look at the expense of the interfaces informativeness? In the end, it was about finding the right 
        balance in every decision I made. Thus, I learned that you cannot have everything, and the tradeoffs you make will largely 
        depend on the function of certain elements and the purpose of your app (e.g. I prioritized information over minimalism on 
        the team profile interface because this interface is meant to inform the user on a team’s season performance.)</p>
