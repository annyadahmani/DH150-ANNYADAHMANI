       <p> By Annya Dahmani </p>

The focus of my project is to design a resource that intersected middle-aged women and happiness. I was inspired by my mother and 
    what makes her happy. My mother loves to bake and baking truly makes her happy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she has been able to have a lot more free time on her hands 
    to explore what makes her happy from home, specifically baking. However, a lot of baking resources aren't tailored to her needs and wants in what she looks for, and instead of using
    a single baking resource to find a recipe and share it with her friends and family, she instead has to use multiple baking apps, which is 
    ultimately inefficient, time-consuming, and takes the fun out of baking. Thus, the goal of my project was to create a baking 
    app that was easy, fun, resourceful, and would create happiness. <br>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p> Baking should be fun and easy. Someone shouldn't need multiple different apps to find a baking
          recipe that is personalized for them. A baking app should be inclusive in the respect in which 
          everything they would need can be found within the singular app, from finding a recipe that is
          vegan to learning about the history to reading reviews to sharing it with friends and family. My project
          aims to keep the happiness and fun in baking and limit the number of apps and web searches a user would
          have to conduct to get what they want. </p>

          <br>
          <br><p> To get a feel of how baking resources presented recipes and what they included, I conducted a very in depth  
            heuristic evaluation on the website <a href="https://www.joyofbaking.com/">Joy of Baking</a> and 
            on the mobile app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cake-and-baking-recipes-for-you/id1211183556">
            Cake and Baking Recipes For You.</a> After getting a sense of how each of these resources presented the 
            information they thought was important, I was able to analyze what each was differing from another and what
            each resource seemed to lack and what each resource seemed to do well, based on Severity Ratings for Usability Problems 
            and a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/">
            scale</a> provided by Nielson Norman Group. After taking into account the description, initial evaluation, 
          and heurisitics evaluation severity ratings, it is evident that both Joy of Baking and Cake and Baking Recipes For You, 
          have usability and comsetic issues that should be addressed so that the mid-aged woman can find true happiness while 
          using this specific web and app.<br><br>
          I was able to use the severity ratings and heuristic evaluations to understand what needed to be done differently 
          for usability and cosmetic needs in order for my project to be user friendly. From these two resources, I found that 
          I wanted to create an app that was aesthetic, easy to use, and could incorporate the aspect of user friendliness as well as making the app fun to use.

After conducting my heuristic evaluation, I decided to focus on Joy of Baking and its usability issues. I was most concerned
           with the lack of a filter and sort feature. I believe this features are important in having in a baking resource, so
          I wanted to see how the lack of these features affected user freedom. I also wanted to look at how a design that
           was non-minamilistic would impact user navigation. After noting these usability issues, I conducted a usability test with
           a participant. <br> <br> In a Zoom call, I had the participant partake in three different tasks that centered around the filter and
           sort methods, the design of the page, and the wireflow of the site.

        <div class="card-body">
          
          <b> The following are the main insights that I took away from the contextual inquiry: </b> <br><br>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Google and Pinterest as resources.</strong></li></br>
      
      I found that Google and Pinterest are used as resources for finding baking recipes. The participant noted
       that the designs were simple, and both resources were easy to use. The participant said that they like how 
      the resources make use of pictures and history information. The participant emphasized that Google has a lot 
      of different recipes when they look up a recipe, and although this is nice, it can be overwhelming when choosing 
      which recipe to choose.
      
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>History behind recipes are important.</strong></li></br>
    
    The participant loves learning about the background and history behind the recipe they are going to bake. The participant 
    said this information is necessary for them to choose what recipe they are going to bake. History is important because 
    it provides context as well as the cultural importance behind a recipe. When looking for a recipe, the participant wanted to 
    know from which culture the recipe originated from.
    
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Looking for an easy way to send and share recipes and pictures to others.</strong></li></br>
  
  The participant said that they look for recipes that are easy to share with her friends and family. This is important because 
  the user doesn't want to take multiple screenshots of the recipe and save all the pictures that go along with it, but would rather
   prefer to have a one-step function to sharing the recipe that is easy and efficient.
  
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Reviews from others are imporant.</strong></li></br>
  
  In the interview, the participant said it was important that a recipe had reviews. This was important to the participant because 
  it allows the participant to know whether the recipe was good or not and if they should actually bake that recipe or choose another 
  recipe. The participant said they don't like when there are no reviews because it's as though they are choosing a recipe blind and 
  with no insight on whether the recipe was tasty or not.

     I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user’s perspective, 
      how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen 
      and facial expressions were recorded. 
<br>
<p class="card-title">Main Findings: </p>

<ul>
<li> All participants were able to complete the three tasks.</li>
<li>Home screen fonts were too small.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time getting to the "done" button after adding a book to their "want to read" bookshelf.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time finding the "share" button.</li>
<li>The "write a book log" was the function least likely to be used by these participants.</li>
<li>Adjectives used the most frequently to describe this app were: creative, familiar, and trustworthy.</li>

    Conclusion

  <div class="card-body">
    <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
      <p>I learned several things during my DH 150 project on the UCLA Bruins app. <br><br> 
        Tradeoffs: UX design is all about tradeoffs. In choosing whether or not to include certain information into my designs, 
        I was constantly faced with dilemmas: do I add more information and make the interface slightly more cluttered, or do I 
        retain the minimalist look at the expense of the interfaces informativeness? In the end, it was about finding the right 
        balance in every decision I made. Thus, I learned that you cannot have everything, and the tradeoffs you make will largely 
        depend on the function of certain elements and the purpose of your app (e.g. I prioritized information over minimalism on 
        the team profile interface because this interface is meant to inform the user on a team’s season performance.)</p>
