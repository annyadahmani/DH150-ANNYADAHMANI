# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Annya Dahmani

## Mid-aged Women's Happiness: Baking Recipe Resources

> My mom is a mid-aged woman, so I am focusing on what makes my mom happy for this project, specifically what parts of cooking make my mom especially happy. My mom, like many other mid-aged women, loves to cook. She loves making her own recipes, copying famous chef's recipes, and sharing her creations with her friends and family. I think especially now, with a lot of people staying home to work due to COVID-19, a lot of people, including mid-aged women, have found happiness in cooking and have taken it as their new hobbie and source of joyness during these difficult times. I wanted to explore different cooking sources that someone like my mom would use. I decided to specifically focus on baking for this assignment. I found two resources for baking recipes and information: an app for cake and baking recipes (Cake and Baking Recipes For You) and a website filled with unique and tasty baking recipes (Joy Of Baking). 


### Severity Rating Scale
This rating uses a 1-3 scale to show what each number corresponds to in terms of problem and priority. **Credit for scale rating given to:** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/

Scale  | Problem  | Information  |
:---: | :---  | :---: |
1  | Cosmetic only |  need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
2  | Minor usability | fixing this should be given low priority  |
3  | Major usability | important to fix, so should be given high priority  |

### Resource no. 1: Joy of Baking
#### Description 
> URL: https://www.joyofbaking.com/ 

> This website is called Joy of Baking. It is a baking recipe website where you can find delicious desert ideas. Baker Stephanie Jaworksi created Joy of Baking in 1997 as a way to engage with other bakers who share the same love and passion for deserts as she does. Each of her recipes comes with a video that shows bakers how to make the perfect desert. The homepage has a categorical index on the left side of the page as well as on the top of the page.

#### Initial overall evaluation
> My initial overall evaluation about this webpage was how busy and chaotic it looked. There is just too much happening and it's overwhelming. I also notice random pictures and text floating on the page. At first glance, it seemed like there was no uniformity within the page. Another initial observation I had was the color coding of the left categorical index. The color coding seemed off where there were light brown, darkbrown, orange, and green colored fonts. I was unsure whether things were normal text or if they were meant to be clicked to take you to another page.
