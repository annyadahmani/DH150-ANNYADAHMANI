# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Annya Dahmani

## Mid-aged Women's Happiness: Baking Recipe Resources

> My mom is a mid-aged woman, so I am focusing on what makes my mom happy for this project, specifically what parts of cooking make my mom especially happy. My mom, like many other mid-aged women, loves to cook. She loves making her own recipes, copying famous chef's recipes, and sharing her creations with her friends and family. I think especially now, with a lot of people staying home to work due to COVID-19, a lot of people, including mid-aged women, have found happiness in cooking and have taken it as their new hobbie and source of joyness during these difficult times. I wanted to explore different cooking sources that someone like my mom would use. I decided to specifically focus on baking for this assignment. I found two resources for baking recipes and information: an app for cake and baking recipes (Cake and Baking Recipes For You) and a website filled with unique and tasty baking recipes (Joy Of Baking). 


### Severity Rating Scale
This rating uses a 1-3 scale to show what each number corresponds to in terms of problem and priority. **Credit for scale rating given to:** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/

Scale  | Problem  | Information  |
:---: | :---  | :---: |
1  | Cosmetic only |  need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
2  | Minor usability | fixing this should be given low priority  |
3  | Major usability | important to fix, so should be given high priority  |

### Resource no. 1: Joy of Baking
#### Description 
> URL: https://www.joyofbaking.com/ 

> This website is called Joy of Baking. It is a baking recipe website where you can find delicious desert ideas. Baker Stephanie Jaworksi created Joy of Baking in 1997 as a way to engage with other bakers who share the same love and passion for deserts as she does. Each of her recipes comes with a video that shows bakers how to make the perfect desert. The homepage has a categorical index on the left side of the page as well as on the top of the page.

#### Initial overall evaluation
> My initial overall evaluation about this webpage was how busy and chaotic it looked. There is just too much happening and it's overwhelming. I also notice random pictures and text floating on the page and a lot of white space on the right side of the page. At first glance, it seemed like there was no uniformity within the page. Another initial observation I had was the color coding of the left categorical index. The color coding seemed off where there were light brown, dark brown, orange, and green colored fonts. I was unsure whether text on the page was supposed to function as normal text or if the text was meant to be clicked on and function as a button to take a user to another page. 

#### Heuristics evaluation
> Here I will discuss all 10 heuristics with sensible argument/comments and possible solutions that I have come up with to help address the arguments/comments.

##### 1. Visibilty of system status
> Should give feedback within a reasonable time about what the user is doing.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | There are pictures and fonts that are on the page that user's would be unsure of whether it is something that is supposed to be clicked or if it is picture. For example, the "Subscribe Now" text is actually a button where if a user clicks it, then they can subscribe to the page. But it needs to be more visible that it's a button and not just text. | Make text that is meant to be clicked look like buttons |
1 | The search bar has a magnifying glass next to it. However it is unclear if that is what a user is supposed to click when attempting to search a recipe. When a user's cursor hovers over the magnifying button, the cursor doesn't change into a hand which most cursors do when encountered with a button. | Make the magnifying glass into a button where if a cursor hovers over it, it will change to a hand cursor |
2 | When clicking the categories in the index on the left side of the page, a user has to click directly on the text in the box. If you click on the light blue tint that doesn't have text on it, then the user won't be directed anywhere. | I think the whole light blue box needs to be a button where if you click on just the blue part without text, it will still take you to the recipe a user is looking for. |
3 | There is no feedback given when a user tries to search something after their initial search in the search bar. After the initial search, if a user tries to search for a new recipe or ingredient, the user is taken to a blank page | Make sure users can search more than just their first initial search |

##### 2. Match between system and real world
> The system should speak the users langauge with words and designs that the user is familiar with and understands.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The search bar needs to be more clear that the text that's supposed to be typed there is what the user is intending on searching. The magnifying glass does not fully represent that. | I think the magnifying glass should be replaced with a Search button and there should be a default text in the box that says search a recipe. |
3 | Below the left category index there is an orange figure that looks like a slanted wifi icon. I was unsure what it was and I clicked it and it brought me to a FeedBurner page for the website. I am still unsure what it is and why this needs to be on the page. ![icon screenshot](icon-screenshot.png) | Remove the icon from page |

##### 3. User control and freedom
> Users need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave that state.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
3 | There is no way to go back to the recipe a user was viewing previously. The only way to go back is to click the 'home' button and then redo the steps to get to where a user was in the first place | Create a back button that traces all the steps a user went through to get somewhere so they don't have to resort to only using the home button. |
3 | User is unable to search more than once | Allow users to search different things more than once |

##### 4. Consistency and standards
> Maintains established meaning of visual elements. The design is consistent throughout the web/app and doesn't confuse users. 

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The left categorical index has text with different font colors. This is inconsistent as there are orange, light brown, dark brown, and green colors that don't establish and meaning. ![font colors](fontcolor-screenshot.png) | Keep the font color the same throughout. |
3 | Once a user searches for something from the home page, the magnifying box switches into a "Search" button. After searching once, the user is no longer able to search again when using the new button and instead shows a blank page | Keep the search button consistent throughout. Make sure user is able to search more than once |
1 | When an image isn't available there are two options the webpage uses: either a blank picture with "No Image Available", or a blank picture with an icon on the top left. This is inconsistent ![no image available](noimage-screenshot.png)![image icon screenshot](toplefticon-screenshot.png)| Either keep the "No Image Available" for all recipes with no images or make sure to provide an image for each recipe (can be just a picture from the web as a filler image) |
3 | Sometimes, depending on what part of the site you're on, the home title "Joy of Baking.com" is no longer used as a home button. Some times a user can click that icon and it will take them to the home page, but other times when a user clicks it, it no longer serves as a means to go to the home page | Make the icon consistent throughout where it can always be used to go home. |
1 | The categories on the top of the site change depending on what part of the site a user is on | Make sure the top categories remain the same no matter where a user is on the site. |
1 | Sometimes when users click one of the options in the left menu bar, the font will all change to light brown and the categories will change places and some will go away and some new ones would be added. | Make sure the left menu categories remain the same no matter where a user is on the site and the color remains the same. |

##### 5. Error prevention
> Prevent people from having to redo their work and provides as a safety net. 

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
Good | If a user types in the search bar and spells something incorrectly, the search looks for words similar to what the user was trying to input ![bananas spelled wrong screenshot](wrongspelling-screenshot.png)| Good as is |
3 | After using the search bar after the initial time, users have to redo their work as the search bar function doesn't work after the first time. Users have to go back to the home page and restart the whole search process instead of being able to search straight from the results page. | Allow users to search on the search page or after the initial search without an error occuring. |

##### 6. Recognition rather than recall
> Provide suggestions to send signals to information from our memory. Allows users to receive cues that give context in actions.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The categories on the top of the site change depending on what part of the site a user is on. This makes it hard for users to be able to recognize their way to navigate the site. Having categories appear and disappear can be confusing to users and their able to recognize. | Make sure the top categories remain the same no matter where a user is on the site so that recognition can remain in tact. |

##### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
> Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways so users can choose their method of interaction.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
3 | There is no filter or sort method when a user searches for a recipe or ingredient. Instead, the page shows all possible options, which is both inefficient and unflexible | Have a sorting algorithm where users can sort either based on time it takes to complete recipe, number of ingredients, servings size, etc. |

##### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
> Making sure content and visual design is focused on the essentials.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | There doesn't need to be a menu on the top and left of the page. Some of them are repetitive. | Delete one of the menu options |
1 | There are four different font colors on the left menu, making it chaotic | Simplify the font color and use only one color for the text |
3 | Some of the designs are confusing because a user can't tell if it's something that is supposed to be clicked, or it's just a text floating | Make buttons appear like buttons where it's obvious that that is something a user should click on |
1 | There doesn't need to be a video icon on every picture of a recipe when every recipe has a video accompanied with it. It's repetitive and hinders the minamilist design. ![video on picture screenshot](video-screenshot.png)| Remove the video icon that is layered on every picture throughout the page. |
1 | After every description under a photo, there is a blue hyperlinked "more" text. This is unecessary when it appears in every description. Users know that they can simply click the title and it will take them tothe information about the recipe. The blue color hinders the minamilist design. | Remove the blue "more" hyperlink. |
1 | There's text that says "Scroll Down For More Recipes" that floats under the top menu bar. It is self explanatory that users would scroll down to find more recipes. The text is in a random place and doesn't help with usability. | Remove floating text that  says "Scroll Down For More Recipes". |

##### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
> Clearly informs users when an error has occured and how to fix it.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
3 | When a user searches something for the second time, the search result is blank. This error has no way of fixing and it doesn't allow users to recognize, diagnose, and recover from this error. ![error with search](nosearch-screenshot.png) | Allow users to search more than once. |

##### 10. Help and documentation
> Makes it easy for users to search for help and lists concrete steps to be carried out.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The Contact Us button doesn't look like a button. It looks like it's text floating on the page. | Make the Contact Us button look like a button. |
1 | The Contact Us should be in one of the menu categories of one of the options users see right away to click. Instead the Contact Us text is at the very bottom of the page, where users could easily miss seeing it. | Don't put the Contact Us information at the bottom of the page. Move it to either the left or top menu bar. |
3 | No FAQ on the website | Add a FAQ page |

### Resource no. 2: Cake and Baking Recipes For You
#### Description 
> This app is called Cake and Baking For You. The app offers a wide range of baking recipes, from cake recipes  to pie recipes to cookie recipes and much more. Users are presented with instructions and photos of the baked goods and are also given the option to choose the recipes they like the most and keep them in their favorites. There is also a shopping list function that you can use when you go grocery shopping. Users can go further and post their own recipes as well as leaving feedback on other's. 

![app homepage](apphome-screenshot.PNG)

#### Initial overall evaluation
> My initial evaluation when I first opened the app was that it doesn't seem to fit my iPhone screen properly. The dimensions look as though it was for a smaller sized device. I had to make an account to get all the features of the app as well. I noticed that it was difficult to navigate around the app and ads would pop up quite often when trying to navigate around the app. I observed that there wasn't as many recipes as I thought a baking app would have, especially from seeing all the different recipes from the previous resource that I looked at.

#### Heuristics evaluation
> Here I will discuss all 10 heuristics with sensible argument/comments and possible solutions that I have come up with to help address the arguments/comments.

##### 1. Visibilty of system status
> Should give feedback within a reasonable time about what the user is doing.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
2 | When a user searches an ingredient or a recipe in the search bar, there is no notification of whether the search has been completed or not. Users would be unsure when to stop typing when they finished typing what they were searching for. | Don't have the search feature be automatic with typing. Users should type, and then when they are finished with their search, have the search notify them  they're search is completed, and bring them to a search results page. |

##### 2. Match between system and real world
> The system should speak the users langauge with words and designs that the user is familiar with and understands.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The categories icon doesn't look correct to me. The icon that is currently used as a categories icon looks more like a layers icon than a categories icon. ![category icon](badicons-screenshot.jpg) | Change the categories icon to something that users would understand as being a category. Maybe it could be as simple as it removing all the icons and having it say "categories" |
1 | In most applications, I feel as though users are used to that if you are active on a certain tab of the page, that icon would be the brightest, and the icons that you aren't on would be dimmer. However, this is the opposite of how to menu works for this app. If you are on a specific section (either home, categories, favorites, shopping list), the  section you are on appears to be dim, and the other sections are brighter. This is confusing because as users, we aren't familiar with this kind of design. | Make the design opposite for when a user clicks on a menu section at the bottom of the app: if a user is on a section, that should be brighter than the non-clicked sections. |

##### 3. User control and freedom
> Users need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave that state.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
2 | When using the hamburger menu on the left side, there is no way a user would know how to exit from the menu. There is no back feature. Users have to tap back onto the main page in order to escape the main menu. If a user didn't know or guess this, then they would be stuck in the main menu page. | Add a back feature from the main menu hamburger back to where the user was previously. |
3 | If a user tries to share a recipe with someone in their contacts, the screen freezes and the user is unable to exit to go back to the page they were on or to escape sending the recipe to someone. Users are then forced to quit the application to get it to work again. | Make the app more responsive in terms of when the user no longer wants to share a recipe with someone in their contacts. Have a back or an exit button that is responsive. |

##### 4. Consistency and standards
> Maintains established meaning of visual elements. The design is consistent throughout the web/app and doesn't confuse users. 

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The backgrounds for different menu options are not consistent. Some backgrounds have solid color background while others have images in the background. ![category background](inconsistent-background-2.jpg) ![shopping list background](inconsistent-background-1.jpg)| Make the background consistent throughout the app, preferably solid color so it's not too busy. |

##### 5. Error prevention
> Prevent people from having to redo their work and provides as a safety net. 

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possibile solutions |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
2 | When sending a review in, there is no option to confirm that the user is okay with their review being posted. The user could have accidentally clicked the send button without meaning to. ![confirmation](confirmation-screenshot.PNG)| Have a confirmation after pressing send that says "Are you sure you want to post" and then have options that say either "Confirm or Cancel." |
2 | There is no message that appears if you send a review and forget to put a title or comment. The user may have accidentally submitted the review and forgot to put a title and comment. ![forgetting text confirm](forgot-text.PNG)| Add a confirmation message that user is forgot to put a title and comment. |
2 | If a user clicks the sign out button in the hamburger menu, the user is automatically signed out. Most apps will ask users if they are sure they want to sign out. | Have a confirmation that makes users confirm if they want to sign out of their account.|

##### 6. Recognition rather than recall
> Provide suggestions to send signals to information from our memory. Allows users to receive cues that give context in actions.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | In the Shopping list feature, users are able to add ingredients from recipes that they want to buy in the future. When the ingredients are added to the list, the list shows just a bullet point of ingredients that a user is intending on buying. However it doesn't have the recipe associated with what the ingredient is intended for. This makes users have to recall the recipe associated with the ingredient. | Next to the ingredient, there should also be a section indicating what recipe that ingredient is intended to be used for. |

##### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
> Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways so users can choose their method of interaction.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | There is no filter algorithm in the search feature. If a user is vegan or allergic to something, there is no way they can sort or account for recipes that don't have certain ingredients. | Add a filter to the search and recipes features where a user can check off certain things that they can't eat or are not looking for in a recipe. |

##### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
> Making sure content and visual design is focused on the essentials.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
1 | The background throughout the app is chaotic (nott minamalist) and makes it hard to focus on the content a user actually wants to see. Sometimes it takes a lot of effort to see the pictures and text of what a user wants to look at when the background is too busy. ![favorite feature background](favorite-background.jpeg) | Keep  the background simple and make the background a solid color. |
1 | There are too many ads that appear on the app at random times. The ads take away from the content users want to be interacting and looking at. | Remove ads from the app. |
1 | The review section is confusing because of it's design. Users would be unsure what's the overall star rating and what is their individual star rating on a review. There's too many stars in the design. ![stars design](review-stars.PNG) | Label what is the user's personal review and the overrall app's review on a recipe. Limit the number of stars. |

##### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
> Clearly informs users when an error has occured and how to fix it.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
2 | If a user types something incorrectly into the search bar, the app doesn't show suggestions of "Did you mean..." Instead it just shows a blank search page. ![search suggestions error](suggestion-search.PNG)| Have the search have a feature that says "Did you mean (insert correct word)" with the most correct word similar to what the user searched.
3 | When a user tries to submit a recipe and forgets to include all the information, the app responds with a confusing error and with no explanation on how to fix it. ![confusing error](error-no-explanation.PNG)| Explain the error better and in a way a user would understand and how to fix the error. For example: Please fill out everything in the recipe in order to submit.|

##### 10. Help and documentation
> Makes it easy for users to search for help and lists concrete steps to be carried out.

Rating  | Arguments/comments  | Possible solutions  |
:---: | :---  | :---  |
3 | There is no help, contact, or FAQ section anywhere on the app. If a user was confused on something, then they would have no way to address their questions. | Add a help center, contact, and/or FAQ section. |

### Conclusion
> In conclusion, after taking into account the description, initial evaluation, and heurisitics evaluation, it is evident that both Joy of Baking and Cake and Baking Recipes For You, have usability and comsetic issues that should be addressed so that the mid-aged woman can find true happiness while using this specific web and app. Addressing the major usability and cosmetic concerns for Joy of Baking, I suggest that the most important things to fix right away are working to fix the inability to search more than the first initial search, working to fix the design and make it more minamalistic and aesthetic, working to make buttons and things that should be clicked look like they are meant to be clicked, and working to make the top and side categories both look and work more efficiently. Addressing the major usabilitty and cosmetic concerns for Cake and Baking For You, I suggest that the most important things to fix right away are working to add a help/contact/FAQ section, working to make errors more understandable, working to make the design more simplistic, and working to fix the glitch when I trying to share a recipe and the app freezes so users are forced to quit the app.
