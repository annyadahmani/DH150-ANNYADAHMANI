# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Annya Dahmani

## Mid-aged Women's Happiness: Baking Recipes

> My mom is a mid-aged woman, so I am focusing on what makes my mom happy for this project, specifically what parts of cooking make my mom especially happy. My mom, like many other mid-aged women, loves to cook. She loves making her own recipes, copying famous chef's recipes, and sharing her creations with her friends and family. I think especially now, with a lot of people staying home to work due to COVID-19, a lot of people, including mid-aged women, have found happiness in cooking and have taken it as their new hobbie and source of joyness during these difficult times. I wanted to explore different cooking sources that someone like my mom would use. I decided to specifically focus on baking for this assignment. I found two resources for baking recipes and information: an app for cake and baking recipes (Cake and Baking Recipes For You) and a website filled with unique and tasty baking recipes (Joy Of Baking).
