# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Annya Dahmani

## Mid-aged Women's Happiness: Baking Recipes

> My mom, is a mid-aged woman, so I am focusing on what makes my mom happy for this project, specifically what parts of cooking make my mom especially happy. My mom, like many other mid-aged women, loves to cook. She loves making her own recipes, copying famous chef's recipes, baking, and sharing her creations with her friends and family. I wanted to explore different cooking sources that someone like my mom would use, and decided to focus on baking for this assignment. I found two resources: an app for cake and baking recipes and a website filled with unique and tasty baking recipes.
