# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype by Annya Dahmani

## Project Description

### Purpose
The pruprose of low fidelity prototyping is to give insight into how a user will interact with the resource that UX designers are designing. It allows designers the ability to have user input and feedback when they are navigating the prototype's functionality and flow. As designers it gives us valuable information about whether featues in the prototype are helpful and useable or confusing and lacking something by the target user demographic. 

### User Personnas
The user personnas I created for this project can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/annyadahmani/DH150-ANNYADAHMANI/tree/main/assignment05">here</a>. Overall, my low fidelity prototype is targeted for users who are interested in baking. This can include any demographic, however, this project is specificially looking at middle-aged women's happiness, so I will be centering the demographics around this. Users should want to learn how to bake recipes, interact with other users on the resource, read and leave reviews, read the history of recipes, share recipes, and use the resource as a social media resource.
