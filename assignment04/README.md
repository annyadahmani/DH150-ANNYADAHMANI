# DH150 Assignment 4: User in context by Annya Dahmani

## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge 

### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
The project will support users in being able to find recipes for baking. I hope to understand how mid-aged woman find happiness when it comes to baking and how to maximize this happiness through user insight.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the user's basic need for happiness because baking can be seenn as a way to escape from their lives as well as a way to calm down. It also provides a community of other bakers that offers a sense of belongingness when users find other people who love to bake. By finding recipes to bake and baking them, users will be able to feel accomplished that they have gained a new baking skill or recipe to show off and use.

### What is the traditional/current solution to satisfy the needs?
The current solution to satisfy the need for baking recipes is to look online for a recipe and blindly choose one that comes up. Another current solution is to have a baking app that you can look up recipes on. And a final current solution is to have a baking book, where users physically look through the pages to find a recipe.

### What are the limitation that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
When using a physical baking book, people would have to look through every page or go to the table of contents to find a recipe. In addition, there is no way to customize features where people are filtering out certain ingredients when it comes to a physical baking book. People would also not be able to input what ingnredients they already have when looking at a baking book. 
Technology improves the limitations of physical baking books by allowing people to find recipes from a wider circle that would allow them to find a diverse range of baking recipes. Contrary, if people were to use baking books, they would be confined to what is in that book.

## Step 2: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographics: people interested in baking. Specifically for this project, mid-aged women.

Preferences: users who bake as a hobby or want to get more into baking as a hobby, and therefore would want a way to find recipes efficiently. Those that find baking as a source of happiness.

Expertise: users do not need to be at any level of expertise for this project.

### Where would the users do that activity? 
To bake, users would look for baking recipes in the kitchen. To find a recipe in advance, users would likely research recipes on the Internet before going into the kitchen to start baking.

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would seach the internet or an app for bakinng rercipes if they were lookinng for something to bake. Additionally, users could also take the non-digital approach and look at a baking book. Users could also reach out to friends and family  about baking recipe recommendations. The ultimate goal of the users is to find an accurate recipe to what they were looking for and be able to preform what the recipe is instruncting them to do in order to create a baked treat. 

## Step 3: Pick research methods

The research method I decided to use was participatory observation. I had my interviewee do activities to give insight on her interest of baking recipes and reactions to baking websites and recipes. The interview was done in the kitchen, which is important because that is where baking is ultimately done. An iPhone was used to record the interview and the iPhone's screen recorrding was used to record the users tasks. This participant is a mid-aged woman, which fits the demographics of my project well.
