# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry by Annya Dahmani

## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 

### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?

### What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

### What is (are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

## Step03: Pick research methods

The research method I decided to use was participatory observation. I had my interviewee do activities to give insight on her interest of baking recipes and reactions to baking websites and recipes. The interview was done in the kitchen, which is important because that is where baking is ultimately done. An iPhone was used to record the interview and the iPhone's screen recorrding was used to record the users tasks. This participant is a mid-aged woman, which fits the demographics of my project well.
