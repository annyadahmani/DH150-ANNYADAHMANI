# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype by Annya Dahmani

## Description of project

### Summary of project
My project is surrounded on the happiness of a mid-aged woman. Specifically, I am focusing on baking. I decide to create an app called Baking + Happiness that does just this. This app allows users to search and explore new recipes that they would later bake. Users are able to leave reviews on recipes and give their comments and a star rating based on their thoughts on a recipe. Another important aspect of the app is the social media aspect. While users can use the app for solely the purpose of searching baking recipes and baking them, users also have the option of creating a social media feed integrated into the app. On this social media page, users are able to post their own recipes as well as interacting with their friends and users they follow. Users are able to see recipes that their friends and users the follow create and leave comments, like, dislike, and share the recipes. This social media aspect integrated into the app makes it easier to have one place where users search recipes and share their creations, rather than searching a recipe on a solely baking recipe app, then posting the results on a different app solely for social media.
