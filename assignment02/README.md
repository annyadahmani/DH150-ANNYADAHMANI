# DH150 Assignment 2: Usability Testing by Annya Dahmani

## Introduction
<a href= "https://www.joyofbaking.com/"> Joy of Baking </a> is a baking website created by baker Stephanie Jawarksi. She started the website in 1997 as a way to engage with other bakers on the web who have the same love for baking and passion for deserts as she does. This website provides bakers and with thousands of delicious desert ideas from cakes to cupcakes to scones to cookies to much more. Users are able to access recipes with videos, ingredients, pictures, back stories, and other information.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability testing is very important in UX design and research. The purpose of it is to get real-life people to examine a website or app. These people are able to idenitfy issues that those who were in charge of and familiar with the website or app wouldn't be able to identify. It's important to have an outside source looking at a website or app because there is less bias when it's someone else revealing issues with the website or  app - and often times these people can see things about the website or app that creators wouldn't have been able to identify. In usability testing, these users are testing the functionality of the website or app by completing tasks on them. Usability testing is also a good way to see how users will behave and think when they are navigating the website or app as they provide insightful and helpful feedback for the improvement of websites or apps.

## Based off my heuristic evaluation
Based off my heuristic evaluation, I want to test how the lack of a filter or sort method affects the usability of the website. The first task has to do with searching for something, finding a specific ingredient, and finding related recipes to that. The second task had to do with searching for something, finding a specific recipe, finding a recipe that was vegan, and finding a recipe that took a certain amount of time. The third task had to do with looking for a recipe without the search bar, finding a specific recipe, and finding the size of a recipe. In my heuristics evaluation I stated that the website's usability would be improved with a filter or sort method and examined whether the particpant thought similarily.

## Methodology
The design of this UT included: orientation script, informed consent form, pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, post-test  questionnaire, system usability scale, productt satisfaction cards, and demographic questions. The participant was my twin sister, Katia. I moderated the usabiliy test from Los Angeles, where my sister is in San Diego, so I used Zoom to record. There were a couple of times  where the internet connection was unstable, so the recording  stopped and I had to restart the recording and put the clips together (three different times). The **orientation script** was an introduction to what was going to be happening and what the participant should expect. The **informed consent** was letting the participant know that they were being recorded and havingt them agree to it. The **pre-test questionnaire** looked at the first impressions of the home page. The three **task scenarios** measured how the participant was interacting with the page in different tasks. The **post-test questionaire** looked at how the participant reflected on their experience on the website and had them answer questions. The **system usability scale** looked at the participant's attitudes. The **product satisfaction cards** looked at what adjectives related to the particpant's thoughts on the website. The **demographics questions** looked at the participants demographics, however I stopped the recording for this section as it supposed to be anonymous.

## Reflection
Reflecting on this usability testing, it went quite smoothly. One thing that I would critique on is that the partcipant, my sister, wasn't the perfect participant for this UT. Although my sister does enjoy baking, she does not fit the "mid-aged woman" requirement for this project. My sister is 20 years old.
